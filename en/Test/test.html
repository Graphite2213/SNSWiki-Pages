In May 2023, a series of mass protests began in Belgrade and other locations in Serbia, following a school shooting in Belgrade and a spree shooting near Mladenovac and Smederevo. The protests, named Serbia Against Violence (Serbian Cyrillic: Србија против насиља, romanized: Srbija protiv nasilja), had been attended by tens of thousands of demonstrators on every protest since 8 May.

Despite being organised by the Democratic Party, Do not let Belgrade drown/Green–Left Front, Party of Freedom and Justice, People's Party and Together opposition parties, no party signs were reported to be seen at the protests. The demonstrators demanded the resignation of Branko Ružić, Bratislav Gašić, Aleksandar Vulin, board members of the Regulatory Body for Electronic Media and Radio Television of Serbia, confiscation of national frequency of Pink and Happy television channels, cancelling the broadcast of reality programs that show and promote violence, and banning print media whose content publishes fake news, violates the Journalistic Code, and promotes violence.

Although not officially one of the demands, demonstrators have also called for president Aleksandar Vučić to resign. The government, including pro-government media, has criticised the protests and demonstrators, while as a response to the protests, Vučić held a gathering, described by critics as a counter-gathering, in front of the National Assembly of Serbia on 26 May. A number of farmers began protesting on 16 May, after the government rejected their demands to improve agricultural conditions. The government partially accepted their demands on 20 May, effectively ending the roadblocks.
